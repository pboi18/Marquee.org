                    <h2>TEAM</h2>

                    <p>Founded in 2012, MARQUEE is a non-government organization [NGO] whose mission is to empower 
                        marginalized communities in Africa.
                    
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        We strengthen local communities by creating platforms for dialogue, enabling informed 
                        debate, and building capacities of citizens on how to hold their government accountable 
                        through Follow The Money.  MARQUEE provides marginalized and vulnerable communities with
                        resources to amplify their voices with independence and integrity while providing the communities
                        with information that ushers social and economic progress.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To enhance effective democratic governance and accountability, MARQUEE creates platforms 
                        [mobile and web technologies] that close the feedback loop between citizens and the government. 
                        With global expertise and reach, we focus on community outreach, influencing policies, practices, and 
                        knowledge mobilization. MARQUEE commitment to participatory capacity & community building and 
                        monitoring and evaluation creates effective and sustainable programs even within the most challenging 
                        environments.
